# **Sloth Data Practice**

The purpose of this repository is to practice using python with pandas and also learn more about sloths by using the data included. 

## [**Sloths**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sloth)

Sloths are among the slowest animals in the world. There are two main species of sloths: three-toed (more accurately three-fingered) and two-toed (two-fingered) sloths. 

### **Three-Toed**

This data includes data for 2662 three-toed sloths.

The types of three-toed sloths include: 
* Pygmy three-toed sloth (Bradypus pygmaeus)
* Maned sloth (Bradypus torquatus)** 
* Pale-throated sloth (Bradypus tridactylus)
* Brown-throated sloth (Bradypus variegatus)

** Maned sloths will eventually be split into two sub-species based on geographical differences and other recent discoveries from recent research. 

### **Two-Toed**

This data includes data for 2338 two-toed sloths. 

The types of two-toed sloths include: 
* Linnaeus’s two-toed sloth (Choloepus didactylus)
* Hoffman’s two-toed sloth (Choloepus hoffmanni)
